# Precomputed-Shadow-Fields-for-Dynamic-Scenes

This is my final project for the course:
**Advances in Computer Graphics**, Zhejiang University, 2015 (Teacher: Kun Zhou)

This is a realization of a paper in SIGGRAPH 2005:
**Precomputed Shadow Fields for Dynamic Scenes** (Kun Zhou etc.)

The program is based on the sample **PRTDemo** in DirectX SDK.

Feel free if you'd like to email me for more detailed information.
